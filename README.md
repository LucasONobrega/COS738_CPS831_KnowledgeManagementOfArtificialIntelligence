**Abstract**

Recent technological advancements have boosted the text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Simulating personas can allow LLMs to provide answers that represent a group of people or specific well-known individuals. However, managing and validating this simulated knowledge poses significant challenges, particularly due to the impracticality of contacting a significant number of experts for direct validation. In this study, we present a framework for managing and evaluating the knowledge of personas generated by LLMs to simulate well-know experts in Delphi studies. The results indicate that LLMs can convincingly and accurately replicate expert perspectives, providing a valuable tool for more effective integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes based on specialized knowledge.
